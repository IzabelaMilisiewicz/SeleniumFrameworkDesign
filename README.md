The project with SeleniumFramework contains:

- taking a screenshot;
- Data Driven Testing & Parametrization using TestNG Data provider HashMap & Json file readers;
- grouping in TestNG.xml;
- TestNG annotations;
- TestNG listeners to capture screenshot on automatic test failures and logging;
- Extent Reports;
- Thread safe mechanism to support tests execution in parallel;
- TestNG retry mechanism to rerun the filed flaky tests in the application.
